## 2026-11-08: milestone 0 (foundation), ready for review

**Done**
- T0.1: sources read and evaluated ([SOURCES.md](SOURCES.md)). Specification,
  plan, curated death dossiers and zoo catalogue copied to `reference/`
  with provenance. Prior art outside Angband surveyed (AutoAscend, BotHack,
  TAEB/Saiph, qw, Rog-O-Matic, NetPlay). A digest of deaths and issues
  by subsystem is in [research/DEATHS-AND-ISSUES.md](research/DEATHS-AND-ISSUES.md).
- T0.2: goals, principles, staged targets and eleven owner decisions,
  all *proposed* ([GOALS.md](GOALS.md)). The design direction is in
  [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).
- T0.3: [PLAN.md](../PLAN.md) (M0–M7, tasks for M1–M3),
  [RULES.md](../RULES.md), [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) (model-agnostic entry;
  `CLAUDE.md` only includes it), `pins.json`, `scripts/setup.sh`, the
  empty crate `borg-reborn-rs/` (`staticlib` + `rlib`, as borg-rs),
  repository consistency tests, CI.

**For the owner to decide (milestone 0 review)**
- D1–D11 in [GOALS.md](GOALS.md#owner-decisions). The ones that shape M1
  most: D2 (engine tree from borg-rs), D3 (information level), D4 (reuse
  of borg-rs code), D9 (workflow).
- Whether the `reviewed` branch starts at the root commit (so the M0 review
  PR shows everything), as set up here.

**Next**
- After the M0 review merges: T1.1 (import borg-rs's `angband/` with
  history). Read PLAN.md T1.1–T1.5 first.

**Known limits**
- Nothing is built against the engine yet. The CI checks only the empty
  crate and the documents.
- The death digest was produced with a model's help from the issue bodies
  and dossiers at the pinned commits. Its classifications are leads, not
  findings. SOURCES.md's table of death patterns was checked by hand
  against the dossiers' `assessment.json`.
